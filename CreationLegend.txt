The Ayodhya Kanda book of the epic Ramayana refers to Varaha retaining his connection to Prajapati as Brahma. In a cosmogonic myth, Brahma appears in the primal universe full of water and takes the form of a boar to lift the earth from the waters; creation begins with Brahma and his progeny.[31][32][15] The Yuddha Kanda book of the epic praises Rama (the hero of the epic, who is identified with Vishnu) as "the single-tusked boar", which is interpreted as an allusion to Varaha and links Varaha with Vishnu.[33][34][35] In the epic Mahabharata, Narayana ("one who lies in the waters", an appellation of Brahma which was later transferred to Vishnu) is praised as the one who rescues the earth as a boar.[36][37]

The Puranas complete the full transition of Varaha from the form of Prajapati-Brahma to the avatar of Narayana-Vishnu. The Brahmanda Purana, the Vayu Purana, the Vishnu Purana, the Linga Purana, the Markendeya Purana, the Kurma Purana, the Garuda Purana, the Padma Purana and the Shiva Purana have similar narratives of the cosmogonic myth, wherein Brahma, identified with Vishnu, takes the Varaha form to raise the earth from the primeval waters.[38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46]

The Brahmanda Purana, one of the oldest Puranas, narrates that in the present kalpa ("aeon") called Varaha kalpa, Brahma wakes from his slumber. Brahma is called Narayana ("he who lies in the waters").[41] The Vayu Purana says that Brahma roams as the wind in the waters, which is interpreted as allusion to the Vedic Taittiriya Brahmana version.[42] Similarly alluding to the Vedic version, the detailed Brahmanda Purana version says that Brahma is "invisible" and a shorter summary says that he becomes the wind.[47] In the Brahmanda Purana, realizing that the earth was in the waters, he decides to take the form of Varaha as the beast likes to sport in the water.[48] Similar reasons for taking the boar form particularly are also given in the Linga Purana,[49] the Matsya Purana[50] and the Vayu Purana.[51][52] The Vishnu Purana adds that Brahma-Narayana decides to take the form of Varaha, similar to the forms of the fish (Matsya) and tortoise (Kurma), he took in previous kalpas.[53][54]

The Brahma Purana, the Venkatacala Mahatmya in the Vaishnava Khanda Book of the Skanda Purana and the Vishnu Smriti narrate the tale with slight variation, however Brahma is missing; it is Vishnu who unambiguously becomes Varaha to lift the sunken earth from the waters.[55][56][57] In late addition in the Mahabharata, the single-tusked (Eka-shringa) Varaha (identified with Vishnu) lifts the earth, which sinks under the burden of overpopulation when Vishnu assumes the duties of Yama (the god of Death) and death seizes on earth.[58][59] In the Matsya Purana and the Harivamsa, at the beginning of a kalpa, Vishnu creates various worlds from the cosmic golden egg. The earth, unable to bear the weight of the new mountains and losing her energy, sinks in the waters to the subterranean realm of Rasatala - the abode of the demons.[60][61] In the first account in the Bhagavata Purana states that in early stages of creation, Brahma creates various beings, however finds the earth under the waters.[62][63] Varaha (identified with Vishnu, the Lord of sacrifice) emerges as a tiny beast (a size of a thumb) from the nostrils of Brahma, but soon starts to grow. Varaha's size increases to that of an elephant and then to that of an enormous mountain and later, he becomes larger than the whole earth and raises it to the intrastellar space where Brahma places the created beings on top of.[16][64]


The Colossal Varaha at Eran is one of the earliest known completely theriomorphic icons of Varaha. It was dedicated by the Huna king Toramana circa 510 CE
The scriptures emphasize Varaha's gigantic size. The Brahmanda Purana, the Vayu Purana, the Matsya Purana, the Harivamsa and the Linga Purana describes Varaha as 10 yojanas (The range of a yojana is disputed and ranges between 6–15 kilometres (3.7–9.3 mi)) in width and a 1000 yojanas in height. He is large as a mountain and blazing like the sun. Dark like a rain cloud in complexion, his tusks are white, sharp and fearsome. His body is the size of the space between the earth and the sky. His thunderous roar is frightening. In one instance, his mane is so fiery and fearsome that Varuna, the god of the waters, requests Varaha to save him from it. Varaha complies and folds his mane.[65][16][66][67][68][69][70][52][71]

Early texts like the Brahmanda Purana and the Vayu Purana build up on the Taittiriya Brahmana Vedic cosmogonic concept of Yajna-varaha (Varaha as sacrifice).[72][73][74] The Brahmanda Purana describes that acquiring the boar form composed of Vedic sacrifices, he plunges in waters, finding the earth in the subterranean realm. Varaha's various body parts are compared with various implements or participants of a yajna (sacrifice). This description of Yajna-varaha was adopted in various other Puranas (like the Brahma Purana,[75] the Bhagavata Purana,[73] the Matsya Purana,[50] the Padma Purana,[76] the Venkatacala Mahatmya of the Skanda Purana,[77] the Vishnudharmottara Purana), the Harivamsa,[78] Smriti texts (including the Vishnu Smriti,[56]), Tantras and Adi Shankara's commentary on the Vishnu Sahasranama explaining the epithet Yajnanga ("whose body is yajna").[65][79][80] The Vishnu Purana, the Bhagavata Purana and the Padma Purana embeds the sacrificial description within a paean to Varaha by the sages of Janaloka after he saves the earth.[81][82][83] Roshen Dalal describes the symbolism of his iconography based on the Vishnu Purana as follows:[16]
