Vedic origins

The origin of Varaha is found in the Vedas, the oldest Hindu scriptures.[11][12][13][14][15] Varaha is originally described as a form of Prajapati (a form of Brahma), but on evolved into the avatara of Vishnu in later Hindu scriptures.[16] Two other avataras of Vishnu - Matsya (the fish) and Kurma (the tortoise) were also equated with Prajapati, a form of Brahma before being shown as forms of Vishnu in later traditions.[13]

Arthur Anthony Macdonell traces the origins of the Varaha legend to two verses (1.61.7 and 8.66.10) of the Rigveda, the oldest Veda. Vishnu, aided by the god Indra, steals hundred buffaloes from a boar (identified Vritra by Macdonell based on verse 1.121.11); and then Indra - shooting across a mountain kills that same boar who is named Ermusha, who is Vritra in disguise.[11][17][18][19] Arthur Berriedale Keith also agrees with Macdonell; interpreting the mountain as a cloud and the killing is a story of the killing of the asura Vritra by Indra.[13] The 14th century Vedic commentator Sayana states the Taittiriya Samhita (6.2.4) elaborates the Rigveda version.[20] However, the Rigveda does not hint at the classical legend of the rescue of the earth by the boar.[21] In the scripture, the god Rudra (a form of the god Shiva) is called the "boar of the sky". Even Vishnu has killed a boar. The hunting and butchering of a boar using dogs is also referred to.[21][12]

The Taittiriya Samhita (6.2.4) mentions that the boar, "the plunderer of wealth", hides the riches of the asuras, beyond the seven hills. Indra kills the board by striking it a blade of sacred kusha grass, piercing the mounts. Vishnu, "the sacrifice" (yajna), brings the killed boar as a sacrificial offering to the gods and goddesses, thereby the gods and goddesses acquiring the treasure of the asuras and asuris and eat the boar.[11][13][22] Vishnu is both the sacrifice as well as the "bringer of sacrifice"; the boar being the sacrifice.[23] The tale is also recalled in Charaka Brahmana and Kathaka Brahmana; the latter calls the boar Emusha.[24][11]

According to J. L. Brockington, there are two distinct boar mythologies in Vedic literature. In one, he is depicted as a form of Prajapati, in other an asura named Emusha is a boar that fights Indra and Vishnu. The section 14.1.2 of the Shatapatha Brahmana harmonizes the two myths and Emusha is conflated into Prajapati.[25]

The earliest versions of the classical Varaha legend are found in the Taittiriya Samhita and the Shatapatha Brahmana; scholars differ on which one is the core version.[26][21][14] The Shatapatha Brahmana narrates that the universe was primordial waters. The earth which was the size of a hand, was trapped in it. The god Prajapati (who is a form of Brahma) in the form of a boar (varaha) plunges into the waters and brings the earth out. He also marries the earth thereafter. The Shatapatha Brahmana calls the boar as Ermusha, which Keith relates to the boar's epithet ermusha in the Rigveda.[26][13][27] In the Taittiriya Samhita (7.1.5), Prajapati - who was roaming as the wind - acquires the form of a "cosmogonic" boar lifting the earth goddess from the primeval waters. As Vishvakarma (the creator of the world), he flattened her, thus she - the earth - was called Prithvi, "the extended one". They produce various deities.[11][28][29]

The Taittiriya Aranyaka (10.1.8) states the earth is lifted by a "black boar with hundred arms".[29] The Taittiriya Brahmana (1.1.3.6) expands the Taittiriya Samhita narrative.[11] The "Lord of creation" was pondering on how the universe should be. He saw a lotus leaf and took the form of a boar to explore under it. He found mud and outstretched it on the leaf, rising above the waters. It was called the earth - Bhumi, literally "that which became (spread)".[29][30]
